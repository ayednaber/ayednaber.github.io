# CS 1XA3 Project 02 - nabera

## Overview
This webpage is Ayed Naber's custom CV that contains all the technical experience and skills in the field of programming and computing, as well as the volunteering and extracirricular activities that have been done. It also contains the skills and qualifications for jobs in the Computer Science field. The website was designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Custom JavaScript Code

**Feature 1:** Enlarging the Personal Photo when Being Clicked On

**Description:** In the header section, a personal photo can be found, where when it is clicked on, a modal will appear on top of the main page, where it includes an enlarged version of the same photo, and a caption under the image which is equal to the text inside the alt attribute of the image, as well as a 'X' button. When clicking 'X', then the modal will close and the page will return to its original view.

**Feature 2:** Multitabbed View of Information

**Description:** In order to list technical experiences, JavaScript was used to design a multi-tabbed view of different experiences, where the content of each tab can be viewed individually. Clicking on each tab switches the content displayed into the content relating to that experience. The content of the first tab is set to be opened by default when the page is opened. This adds more variety in terms of viewing different information on the resume.

**Feature 3:** Toggling Between Dark Mode and Light Mode

**Description:** A button is placed in the header of the page, where when it is clicked, a JavaScript function is activated. The website is set to dark mode by default when it is first opened. That JavaScript function gets every element in the document that requires its color to be changed, and it changes the text color to a dark color, while changing their background color to white. It also changes the background color of the page to a light color. This allows the user going through the resume to view it in a different color scheme, the text of the button will change to dark mode. When the button is clicked again, then dark mode will return. This is accomplished through using the toggle function, as well as if statements.

**Feature 4:** Show/Hide Image

**Description:** For one of the volunteering experiences, a photo is provided, but its display is set to none by default, and the button that is visible says "Show Image". When clicking it, the image appears, and the button's text will change to "Hide Image". Therefore, clicking the button again will set the display of the image back to none, and rechange the button's text back to "Show Image", and so on.
